Explore how shape-based bias replaces race or class, and what happens when someone finds a way to forge or hide their true form.",
    "Describe a future in which time itself becomes fractured by overuse of temporal technology. History becomes unstable, facts blur, and personal memories are no longer reliable. Schools teach probabilistic history, courts rely on memory audits, and personal timelines fork without warning. Follow a historian trying to piece together a coherent truth while society collapses under the weight of nonlinear reality.",
